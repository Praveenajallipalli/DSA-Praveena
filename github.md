# Git Tutorial and Basic Commands
## Version control System?
### Version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. So ideally ,we can place any file in the computer on version control 
1. maintains versions of your code
2. maintains history of your changes 
--- 
## Here's why:
### A version control system allows you to revert files back to previous state. revert the entire project to a previous state ,review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem ,who introduce an issue and where, and more.Using a VCS also means that if you screw things up or lose fils , you can generally recover easily .And sometimes you just want to know "who wrote the crap" , and having access to that information is worthwhile?

## _So what is git?_
### **Git**  is a **version-control system for tracking changes** in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is a **Distributed Version Control System**. So Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project files. Instead, every user "clones" is a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like GitHub.
#### Github is a platform for using git.
#### Github,bitbucket,gitlab all are using git. Github ,bitbucket vcannot work without git.
